# Simple Chatbot with LangChain and OpenAI

## Introduction

This repo contains a simple implementation of a chatbot using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). The code is based on the ["Build a Chatbot"](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/chatbot/) LangChain tutorial, but with modifications to store the chat history on a SQLite database.

The chatbot is implemented on a Jupyter Notebook (using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)) as well as a Flask application.
